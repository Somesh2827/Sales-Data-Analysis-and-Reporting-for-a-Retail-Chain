Presenting My Internship Final Project: Retail Chain Sales Analysis Using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI

My internship project involved analyzing sales data for a retail chain using a combination of Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI. The dynamic dashboards created in Excel and Power BI provided actionable insights that supported data-driven decision-making across various business functions. Python's robust data manipulation capabilities, combined with SQL's efficient data extraction, allowed for an in-depth analysis that brought forward key business insights.

Project Overview: This Sales Data Analysis and Reporting project harnessed the power of Python for statistical analysis and data manipulation, alongside SQL for precise data retrieval from databases. These insights were then visualized through dynamic dashboards in Excel and Power BI, highlighting crucial sales metrics and trends. The outcomes of this project enabled the retail chain to make informed decisions in areas like inventory management, targeted marketing strategies, and identifying growth opportunities. This experience underscored the practical impact of data analysis in driving business success.

Thank you!
